# Today What I Studied

I studied SQL using public open data related to subway.

- The most important thing in `SQL` is to get the insight from the meaningful information.
- It is a kind annoying when the columns of a table are too much. Thus, you have to make a new table that is normalized and simple.
- If you use subway data in `SQL` and preprocess them, you can find any meaningful information:  Which station, where people get off, people spend their money
