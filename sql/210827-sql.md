# Today what I studied about SQL

Today is the final day when I study online.

The following things are the list that I studied today:

- when importing the data of CSV type, you have to be careful in the encoding.
- In the case of the mass amount of data, use 'delete' command to remove the unusful header and data.
- make the index: think of a kind of table of contents.
- using the `join`, you can make a table used two or more data.
- normalization: divide and divide for data to perform as meaninful data
- if you combine two or more data, you can find out various, meaningful info.
