# What I learned in the last SQL class

- Replication & MongoDB
1. Replication: use the master DB and the slave DB using the two AWS Instance servers and make the new connections that is named as "Master" and "Slave"

When you insert or update data (and moreover, create tables or databases) on Master DB, they are also included in the Slave DB. 

2. MongoDB: This is a kind of NoSQL. This program uses the JAVA programming language for queries. 

- NoSQL: No relation between tables and other tables

- TMUX: This is used for pair programming, so you can write commands as checking others' commands at the same time.
