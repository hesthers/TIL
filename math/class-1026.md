# What I learned today in math class

## Statistics (basic concepts)
- Descriptive statistics
1. mean/median/mode/quantile
2. variance/std(standard deviation)
3. correlation coefficient/covariance
4. regressional coefficient

- Inferential statistics
1. sample and population
2. difference between sample and population (how to explain the population using the sample)

- practice about linear regression and EDA using .ipynb (with python code)
data: the prediction of amount of electricity used (Dacon data)
