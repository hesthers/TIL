# Today What I Learned in the Class

I learned `function` and `class object` and more about iterations with practice questions.

- functions:

the user-defined functions and the built-in functions(command for data) in python

functions are for reusability.

use the word to define function, `def`, and parameters are needed for functions

- class object:

a kind of the bundle of functions 

useful to reuse some codes

Before making other class objects, you have to define the initial class object, `__init__`.

- when you use the built-in python functions, use the command `import`.

But, you should install some python packages first.

- `random`: a kind of python built-in packages

you can use this in various ways and coding.
